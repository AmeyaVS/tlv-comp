# Fibonacci Example

This directory contains the source generated by `svgen` tool for the example `fibo` as referenced from the link:../../examples/fibo[fibo] directory.

## How to build and run the example

Use the script link:[runme.sh] from the console which would process the files generated from the `svgen` tool.

As well as configure and build the project using CMake and Verilator.

```sh
$ sh runme.sh
```

### Manually running the example

One needs to run the runme.sh script for process the generated sources.

```sh
# Go inside the build directory
$ cd build

# Configure the project
$ cmake ..

# Building the executable
$ make

# Running the example
$ ./fibo

# Running the example with VCD Trace enabled
$ ./fibo +trace
```
